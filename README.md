# Low_power_environmental_logger
A DIY environmental logger, the device uses an Arduino micro-controller, compatible analogue or I2C digital sensors, a DS3231 real time clock (RTC) module and a TF Micro SD Mini SD Card Module to track environmental changes over several months. This example was written for a device that can track changes in cave water levels during flood events with a pressure sensor.
